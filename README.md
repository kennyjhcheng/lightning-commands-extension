# **Lightning Terminal Commands Extension for VSCode**

Lightning Terminal Commands is an extension that brings Commands.dev usability straight to your VSCode command palette. 

Oftentimes, we know what we need to do but forget how to translate our goals into the correct syntax within the terminal. The subsequent goose chase through Google and StackOverflow forces us to switch contexts away from the IDE, breaking focus, wasting precious engineering time, and can be extremely frustrating.

Our goal in creating this extension was to solve this frustration of switching tabs and breaking focus by providing developers searchable parameterized and templated terminal commands, either through direct syntax or command descriptions, straight from your Command Palette and into your IDE Terminal!

This extension uses opensource material and is meant to provide value by bridging the gap between the commands.dev website and Visual Studio Code.
